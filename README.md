# DePrint

Ever forget to remove print or log statements from your code only to realize much later? Here's a simple solution. DePrint provides you the option of commenting or removing these statements entirely so that your code is as tidy as tidy can be.

> Currently Supports JavaScript Family and Python files. Bash coming soon!

## Usage

Open the Command Palette choose

`Comment Print and Logs`  
This comments all statements in the current file.

`Delete Commented Print and Logs`  
This deletes all statements in the current file. (Coming Soon!)
